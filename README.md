# sqlalchemy-challenge
I placed my Jupyter notebook and app.py scripts inside the "SurfsUp" folder. These files are the core of my project, where I conducted analysis and built the Flask API.

Resources:
I visited Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3750118/sqlalchemy-max-function) to understand how to use SQLAlchemy's func.max function. This function was crucial in finding the most recent date in my dataset.

I referred to the SQLAlchemy documentation (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) to brush up on my SQLAlchemy skills. It provided detailed explanations and examples of SQLAlchemy's features.

To learn how to create routes in Flask, I read the Flask Quickstart documentation (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/quickstart/#routing). It helped me structure the routes in my Flask application effectively.

My teacher on Slack shared a helpful resource, the Flask jsonify documentation (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/api/#flask.json.jsonify), which taught me how to format data as JSON responses in my API.
